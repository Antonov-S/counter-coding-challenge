# Coding Challenge Rules:

1. create a react application that allows uers to count from 0 to 5.

   - create + button that increases the current count . It can be clicked as many times as needed.
   - create - button that reduces the current count by one. It can be clicked as many times as needed.

2. create an "reset" button that set current count to 0.

3. create a functionality through which increases the current count by one when when the spacebar is pressed. It can be clicked as many times as needed.

4. when the count reaches 5 the title changes automatically.

5. when the count reaches 5 some styles changes automatically.

6. when the count reaches 5 the "+" and "-" buttons can be focused, but their functionality is stopped.

7. negative values are not allowed.
